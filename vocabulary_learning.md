And so I think what you can do is kind of take a more modular approach to PLG, and it's like based on how a customer in the best case scenario might go from zero to one when it comes to **activation** and onboarding, do we need to have a human involved in that process at all? #growth

So that was interesting to me because I assumed that you should always just focus on existing user retention, but for a product like Grammarly, it's actually the **activation** installation aha moment that's really, really critical and will carry the user for a very, very long time. #growth

### activation

**/ˌæktɪˈveɪʃən/** · n. · ⭐

So that's the overall process and ultimately it's a really strong model that allows us then to feed in the set of user level behaviors that we know can influence those different steps on that path to **activation**. #growth

So, I guess the question is just what's your take on user specific **activation** metric versus workspace level **activation** metric? #growth

### activation

**/ˌæktɪˈveɪʃən/** · n. · ⭐

激活

So, the idea there is when you're picking an **activation** metric, you want it to be in the single digits potentially because you're saying that's more likely to be correlated with retention because retention's probably pretty low long term. #growth

### activation

**/ˌæktɪˈveɪʃən/** · n. · ⭐

And I've really been doing that my entire career, Gibson Biddle (56:16): So, if you embrace this idea of experimentation, you're like a product, you need to have **hypothesis**, you need to try see what works. #growth

### hypothesis

**/haɪˈpɒθəsɪs/** · n. · ⭐⭐

And so coming back to how do we execute just a little bit differently and some of the learnings there where I think the first time we started growth, we could have been more user-centric and been a lot more **hypothesis** driven. #growth

And so if you bring a strong **hypothesis** to, that this is a real problem, even if customers aren't telling you it's a problem because they've just sort of gotten used to it. #general

And so if you don't have a tested **hypothesis**, if you can't think of a way to run an experiment, then honestly that idea is pretty useless. #growth

### hypothesis

**/haɪˈpɒθəsɪs/** · n. · ⭐⭐

假设

And so in larger organizations it's very difficult because at some point the dominant market research is about **hypothesis** testing, "I'm going to go build a **hypothesis** and go basically then go build a research project to prove or disprove that **hypothesis**. But the reality is. #leadership

### hypothesis

**/haɪˈpɒθəsɪs/** · n. · ⭐⭐

If you assume that's true, then a bunch of things kind of follow from that postulate, that **hypothesis**, which is, "Oh, well, just like we would never build a product without talking to customers, we would never build a culture without talking to the customers of the product, which are the people. #leadership

Of course everyone has incorporated AI part of it is you get it, you kind of want to be in the game and be cool, but if it doesn't really fit with your product **hypothesis** and thesis and what your customers are asking for, don't fall for that fad. #product

Recognizing that **hypothesis** actually says something about maybe how long the experiment needs to be run or what kinds of data analyses need to be done. #growth

假设

So it might be a **hypothesis** that this segment of customers is going to be willing to pay for this product because it's solving an urgent and important enough need for them that they're going to go do it and this is the evidence we have to find it, but this is also the stuff we don't know. #product

So that could be customer support or ticket volume or feature adoption, whatever the case is, it may not be an output metric in the traditional A/B test, but some more rigorous system that says, hey, I had this **hypothesis**, we just shipped it for x, y, z constraint reason for red. #growth

### hypothesis

### hypothesis

**/haɪˈpɒθəsɪs/** · n. · ⭐⭐

假设

The original PM running that experiment doesn't necessarily need to be the person that figures out what you should do for all the other parts of your product experience, but the onus is on them to clearly articulate what their **hypothesis** is, what they found such that then as a growth leader. #growth
